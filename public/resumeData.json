    "bio":"I am a graduating Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Massachusetts Boston (under the supervision of Professor Bo Sheng). I received my B.A. from Skidmore College in 2012, majoring in Mathematics and Economics. Then I received my M.S. from New York University in 2014, majoring in Mathematics. My research interests include Congestion control in Disaggregated Storage Systems, Edge Computing, Mobile Computing, Big Data Analytics, and Distributed Systems. During the past four years, I have collaborated with Air Force Research Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory, and Samsung on several research projects.",
